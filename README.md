## My process
- Evaluate the design 
- Look through the design with the design to out some measurement with Adobe Photoshop
- Decide on where to use flexbox or grid (I choose flexbox)
- Wrtie my first line of HTML and add Favicon
- Arrange my SASS, link my css to my html and test if my SASS is working well 
- Add all variable style and reset style 
- start coding the webpage 
- check for responsiveness 
- write README

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM METHODOLOGY
- CSS (SASS)
- Flexbox
- CSS GRID
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

- The important of max width over width can still not be overemphasized, I enjoyed using it on this project 

### Continued development

- Keep improving my css skills and also my JavaScript skills. 

- Code more often
